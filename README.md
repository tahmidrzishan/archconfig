## 🚀 Installation

> ⚠️ Before proceeding, make sure you **backup your existing config files** if needed.


```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The script will guide you through the setup. You can install what what you need, and don't have to install what you don't.

## 🛠 Customization

Feel free to modify the `sway_config` and `i3_config` files as needed. After making changes, run the `update.sh` script to save them back to this repo.
